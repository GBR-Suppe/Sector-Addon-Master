This is a working Taviana Example in the mission.sqm !!!! But, it is just an example !!!!

* for Taviana I would increase the "AI Patrolraduis" ( ...\Sector_addon\init\fn_init.sqf)
* Line 24-33 all //FillHouse from 300 to 500
* and Line 36-43 all //Millitarize from 300 to 800
* or take the fn_init.sqf in this folder and replace it with the ...\Sector_addon\init\fn_init.sqf

Optional:
- Sort the markers in the Arma3 Editor...
- Or add more markers (dont forgot the fn_init.sqf)
- Or increase the AI spawn (in the fn_init.sqf)

Info: (by default)
Marker 1-10 fills all buildings in defined range, with soldiers., so u need more houses there.....
Marker 11-18 are Millitarize, Fills area with units. work without houses.
